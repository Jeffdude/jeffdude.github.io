      <h4>About Me:</h4>
      <p style={{margin: "0.5em 0 0 1.5em"}}>
        I am a highly driven goal-oriented software engineer with a variety of
        technical experience aquired through self-teaching, industry experience,
        and formal education.  After over five years experience in dynamic
        large-scale system architecture and administration from my time at
        Facebook and ViaSat Inc., I began pursuing my passion for entrepreneurship
        and freeskating. I am a co-owner and CTO of JMKRIDE USA. After two and a
        half years of technical and leadership work, I am in a position where I
        have begun offloading and sidelining my responsibilities at JMKRIDE and am
        looking to continue my career with an exciting remote/hybrid role in full
        stack software development.
